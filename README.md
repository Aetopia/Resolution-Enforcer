# Resolution Enforcer
A simple program to enforce desktop resolutions on specific applications. (Win32 and UWP apps.)

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a program that can restore external fullscreen resolution changing functionality into applications by enforcing application specific desktop resolutions.
