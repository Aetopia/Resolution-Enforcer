# Resolution-Enforcer
Enforce desktop resolutions on specific applications. (Win32 and UWP apps.)

## Aim
The aim of this project is to create a program that can restore fullscreen resolution changing functionality into applications by enforcing application specific desktop resolutions.
Mostly aimed at games or software which do not offer an option to select the fullscreen resolution. 

## Setup
1. Install Python `3.10`.
2. Install the following modules or use `requirements.txt`.
```
pip install -r "requirements.txt" 
```
OR
```
pip install pywin32
pip install psutil
```
3. Open up `Options.ini`.  
   Run the script/application to generate an options file.        

   Add UWP apps or Win32 apps that should be filtered out by the program.        

   UWP Apps => Only include the name of the app. (Case Sensitive.)        
   Win32 Apps => Only include the name of executable. (Case Sensitive.)             

   Example:
   ```ini
   ; Configuration file generated by Resolution Enforcer.

   [General]
   ; Set the delay between application checks in seconds.
   ; Increase this value if you experience high CPU usage.
   Delay = 0.1  

   [Applications]
   ; Title or Executable Name = Resolution

   Minecraft = 1280x720
   HaloInfinite.exe = 1600x900
   ```
